- The Header
    - The header has a hero image in its background of a buddhist shrine, it's colours being the spine of the layout for the rest of the site.
    - The cover text over the hero image reinforces who we are, what we do and where we do it in a minimal fashion.

    - Seperated by linear gradient dividers to take the edge off the section

- The About section
    - The layout of the about section was used using the grid display which was learned on the app Mimo. A series of images creating an environment which we would like to portray to the customer.
    - The About us section gives a very brief and non stressing description on our capacities, laid out the horizon over water aimed to relax and soothe.

- Courses section
    - In the Courses section we have a title centered above two cards describing what both the yoga and meditation course offer.
    - The background of the card was a texture image of wood to provide a natural element to the page while staying within the color range.
    - Each card depicts the different styles of meditation & yoga on offer if any of the customers had preference.

- Sign up section
    - The Sign Up page has a form that collects details from the customer so they can join up to one or both of the courses they've chosen.
    - The information allows us to contact the customer from our database via email about joining and other offers that are available.
    - In the background the image is another image within the color palette range as to keep to continuity of the site.

- Footer
    - The footer has a header with a logo beside it that is linked back to the homepage.
    - Below their is a motivational message followed by an animated sign up button to speed up the sign up process by jumping them straigh to sign up in case they dont want to go through the sites information first.
    - Beneath the button are the social media links that go directly to their respected pages in new tabs so they dont leave the meditation site.
    - At the bottom of the footer is a makeshift copyright note of the website.

### Bugs
- When first creating the home page there was an issue with the CSS and the 'our mission' section. The layout was not falling into place but was then quickly fixed with flexbox and some minor adjustments.
- When working on the footer I was having an issue with the fontawesome icons. They were not displaying. After a bit of research I inserted the missing 'script' tag and link required for it to function.
- When working About page issues were had with flexbox and reverted back to lesson learned on Mimo app about Grid and took reference from kevin powell youtube video on css grid to achieve this.
- An issue arose with the sign up button on the footer which i fixed with the on_click attribute via scaler.com
