### Built with

### Bugs
- When first creating the home page there was an issue with the CSS and the 'our mission' section. The layout was not falling into place but was then quickly fixed with flexbox and some minor adjustments.
- When working on the footer I was having an issue with the fontawesome icons. They were not displaying. After a bit of research I inserted the missing 'script' tag and link required for it to function.
- When working About page issues were had with flexbox and reverted back to lesson learned on Mimo app about Grid and took reference from kevin powell youtube video on css grid to achieve this.
- An issue arose with the sign up button on the footer which i fixed with the on_click attribute via scaler.com
